# REact Periodic Table App
A React app that uses a Periodic Table API to generate a variety of views. Very much a practice app for using Context, UseReducer and styled components.
**React practice app**
My goal in this project is to simply fetch an API of Periodic Table element data and use it to create interesting views and functionality. The project will use React Router, Contetx and useReducer, with styling predominantly done via styled components.
